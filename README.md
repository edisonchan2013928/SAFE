# SAFE
This is the implementation for our paper "SAFE: A Share-and-Aggregate Bandwidth Exploration Framework for Kernel Density Visualization", which is submitted to VLDB2022 for review. We do not upload the datasets in this link, since the dataset size is too large. Nevertheless, all datasets are the open data (cf. Table 4) from the local governments in different cities, which can be easily downloaded from their websites (check the references in Table 4).
